<h2 class="orange fw6">The Brief:</h2>
As a business we’re looking to add more filtering capability so that users can find products and content easier across the website. This will be present on category/collection pages and also on search results. In addition we need to ensure that the filters work well on a small screen devices as over 45% of traffic is on mobile & tablet. 

<h2 class="orange fw6">Skills Used:</h2>
Concept Mapping, User Interviews, Affinity Mapping, User Flows, Prototyping, User Testing & User Interface Design.
Software used: Omingraffle, Photoshop, Sketch & Marvel.

<h2 class="orange fw6">The Problem:</h2>
The current filtering is very limited, users can only filter by size and there is no way to sort between the different collections such as "Pro Team" & "Brevet". As the collection grows it becomes increasingly difficult for users to navigate the shop pages, an improved filter should more visible and allow users to refine there results more effectively. 

<h2 class="orange fw6">Competitive Analysis:</h2>
Here I will type some words about the competitive analysis

<h2 class="orange fw6">The Insight:</h2>
80% of users who interact with the filter go on to complete a purchase but only 5% of total users interact with the filters. If we can increase the number of interactions we can increase conversion.
