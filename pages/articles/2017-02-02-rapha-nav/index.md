<h2 class="orange fw6">The Brief:</h2>
Test existing Rapha navigation with customers and assess its effectiveness. Look at the information architecture and suggest a more user-friendly approach that will enable new customers to navigate the site without much prior knowledge of the cycling industry. Create a navigation that has a better balance of content and commerce, these areas are currently very separate and by creating more links between the two, we can extend time spent on site and page views. 

<h2 class="orange fw6">The Problem:</h2>
Rapha's navigation has grown with the company, at the beginning the product catalogue was less than 10 items and so it was easy for customers to find what they were looking for. The range now exceeds 350 product lines covering a wide range of types, the navigation has grown piecemeal with the collection and has never been appraised for its effectiveness. We need to observe how the current navigation is being used and find out how our customers would expect the products to be categorised.

 <h2 class="orange fw6">The Idea:</h2>
With more and more people joining the cycling revolution we need our product catalogue to be easy for new customers to understand. We know that "Riding Accessories" is a very confusing term as it could cover most items, users expect products to be grouped by type eg. Tops and that even though Rapha Events & Rides are a large selling point for the company, they are very difficult to find, even by the most seasoned Rapha Customers. By better categorising the products and changing the primary navigational headings we can make it easier for both new and existing customers to find what they are looking for. 


<h2 class="orange fw6">Testing & Iteration:</h2>

<h2 class="orange fw6">Outcome:</h2>
We have three navigations that can be developed and multi-variant tested on the live site.
