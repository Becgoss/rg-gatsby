I am a Senior UX Designer with 10 years of experience in the industry, working in both startups and large corporations.

Exploring problems and putting the user at the centre of my work is something I am deeply passionate about. I thrive on finding solutions that are both creative and impactful, something I will continue to strive for in all areas of my work. In our ever increasing digital lives, I am excited to make a difference to peopleâ€™s experiences within a cross functional and collaborative team.

<!-- A UX Designer with an e-commerce background for a Fast Track 100 company in Product Management and User Experience Design. Whilst working in a multidisciplinary team, researching, testing and delivering digital product across all areas of the business, I spent a large part of my time fulfilling the role of UX Designer and decided to hone my skill set in this area. Above and beyond my commercial UX Experience I've also trained at General Assembly which helped me consolidate my UX knowledge by applying it to a number of new briefs including one for Newsflare. -->
